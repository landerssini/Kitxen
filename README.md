## üöÄ About Me
First of all, I want to say that this is my first ‚Äúbig‚Äù project that I have been working on alone. I have learned many things about APIs, new libraries, and new ways to make my code more compact. I am proud of my work and I know that in a year I will look back at this project and laugh at silly mistakes, bad practices, and more.

## API Reference
### Spoonacular API

Spoonacular is a powerful recipe and food API that provides detailed information about ingredients, recipes, grocery products, and menu items. Their knowledge engineers have spent years crafting a complex food ontology that allows them to understand the relationships between ingredients, recipes, nutrition, allergens, and more.

The API provides a wide range of features such as recipe analysis, meal planning, shoppable recipes, special diets/intolerances, nutritional information, and more. It is used by hundreds of universities, schools, companies, and hackathons all around the world.
